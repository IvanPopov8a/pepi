The castle was quiet at night.
A lantern shined in the tower.
A shadow moved behind the curtain.
Was someone watching you?

The river flowed gently.
 It reflected the moonlight.
 Nearby, an owl hooted.
 The forest seemed mystical.

The old book lay on the table.
Its pages were yellowed and torn.
A map fell out as it was opened.
Where could it lead?
