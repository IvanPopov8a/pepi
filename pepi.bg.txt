The castle was quiet at night.
A lantern flickered in the tower.
A shadow moved behind the curtain.
Was someone watching?

The river flowed gently.
 It reflected the moonlight.
 Nearby, an owl hooted.
 The forest seemed alive.

The old book lay on the table.
Its pages were yellowed and torn.
A map fell out as it was opened.
Where could it lead?
