The castle was quiet at night.
A lantern illuminated the tower.
A shadow moved behind the curtain.
Was someone watching me?

The river flowed gently.
 It reflected the moonlight.
 Nearby, an owl hooted.
 The forest seemed whimsical.

The old book lay on the wooden table.
Its pages were yellowed and torn.
A map fell out as it was opened.
Where could it lead?
